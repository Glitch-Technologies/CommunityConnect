# CommunityConnect
Collect, store and parse information on local business and community partners.

Our team here at Glitch Technologies designed this software to be used for the 2024 FBLA Coding and Programming Competition. It's licensed under GPL because what kind of a person wouldn't do that. This app will be written in Dart and probably use Python to handle backend implementations.

# The Prompt
Create a program that allows your schoolâ€™s Career and Technical Education Department to
collect and store information about business and community partners. This program should
include information on at least 25 different partners (real or fictional), with details such as,
but not limited to, the type of organization, resources available, and direct contact
information for an individual. The program should enable users to search and filter the
information as needed.
